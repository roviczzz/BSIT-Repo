<h2>My Experience in the Midst of the Pandemic</h2>

Early 2020, discussions about the harm brought by the COVID-19 began to circulate around the globe due to its harmful
effects. It was a critical concern among countries and resulted in implementing nationwide lockdowns. These include the prohibition of face-to-face operations
such as on-site works, institutions, schools, religious activities, and such. In my experience, this became hindrance not only to my academics 
but including the livelihood and health of every family. Additionally, practical applications such as moving work and academics to online setting
is a big adjustment for those who aren't familiar with it. Fortunately, I spend most of my time on learning how to efficiently use the computer before the pandemic.

<p>
At that time, I was in my Senior High and it was unique for us to be on an online setting. It was a game changer, I liked the
mode of platform at first but later on, it became an obstacle besides academically but also our well-being. Learning at home
became a challenge but especially my programming classes. It was a blast for me to learn and experience encoding on several programming languages in finding my forte.
These include <strong>Python, Java, SQL, C#, HTML, and CSS</strong>. Besides programming, I also learn 3D animating through the use of Blender and made several output for our animation class.

<p>
Aside from academics, I do engage myself in my hobbies and exploring other activities at home. These include playing and streaming
various video games, listening to different kinds of music, reading, watching Netflix, Youtube, Anime, and Twitch, 
Talking to my classmates and friends online, learn how to maintain my well-being and taking a bike outside when restrictions are lessen.
The video above is my memorable highlights of my Senior High since I participated in our intrams (Animo Esports) and won the <strong>VALORANT High Elo Championship</strong>.
